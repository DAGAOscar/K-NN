The project involves implementing the K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) algorithm, 
a supervised learning method used for classification. The goal is to classify 
data points based on their proximity to other labeled points. The implementation 
includes data preprocessing, distance calculation, and optimization of the parameter K. 
Using Python libraries like scikit-learn, the algorithm is applied to a dataset, and performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy and precision.
